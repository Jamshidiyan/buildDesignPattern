The Builder pattern is a design pattern used to create complex objects step by step.
This pattern provides a high-level API for creating objects, allowing us to avoid constructors with many parameters.

Here's how the Builder pattern works:

    Define an abstract class (Burger) or interface with required properties.
    Create a separate Builder class with the same properties as the Burger class.
    The Builder class provides a method called "build()" which creates and returns the final Burger object.
    Use the Builder class to create instances of the Burger class by setting the required properties step by step.

The main advantages of the Builder pattern are:

    Encapsulation: It helps in separating the construction logic from the business logic.
    Immutability: Once an object is created using the Builder pattern, it can't be changed, providing better security and thread-safety.
    Ease of reading: It improves the readability of the code, making it easier to understand.

The main disadvantage of the Builder pattern is that it requires more classes and more code to create objects compared to other design patterns.
However, it offers significant advantages in terms of code maintainability and flexibility.
